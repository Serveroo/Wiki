   Automatic renewal is not currently available. If you wish to extend your experience, it will be possible to extend the service from this page.

3. Once you have made your purchase, you will be redirected directly to the page for your various services. You can therefore see the configuration of your service.

4. To be able to use your service, you need to upload your project to the service file area. You need at least one index.html file.
